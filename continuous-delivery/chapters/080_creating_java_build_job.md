# Creating  Build Job for a Java Project

In this chapter, we are going to create a job to build/compile a sample java application with maven.

## Creating Maven Project

Before we start to create our build job, we need to install **maven-integration** plugin.

To create a build project,

* From New Item, select **Maven Project** and provide it a name e.g. "build".

**Note**: If you do not see **Maven Project** option on the job creation page, install **Maven Integration Plugin** from plugins manager.

* From the configuration screen, scroll to Source Code Management, select GIT and provide repository URL

e.g. https://github.com/schoolofdevops/demo

From **Build Triggers** select **Poll SCM**. Lets configure it to poll every 5 minutes using the following schedule

```
H/2 * * * *
```

* Scroll down to Build step and you should see Root POM selected since its a Maven Project. In the Goals and options section, provide **compile** as a goal.

In addition to compile, following are the goals Maven project could take.

1. validate
2. compile - compile source code
3. test - unit tests
4. package - build jar/war
5. integration-test
6. verify
7. install
8. deploy

* Save the job and click on **Build Now**.  Following is a snippet from the output of the build job.

```
