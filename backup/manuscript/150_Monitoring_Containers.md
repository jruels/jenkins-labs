# Monitoring Containers

In this chapter we are going to monitor logs from container. This can be achieved by using the various monitoring tools, we use...

* ELK Stack - Log Monitoring

* Prometheus Stack - Performance Monitoring

* Papertrail - Cloud-based log management

* Datadog - Cloud Monitoring as a Service

## Log Monitoring

### ELK Stack

* Clone the following repository

```
https://github.com/vijayboopathy/devops-demos.git
```

* Install Docker Compose by using the **Docker_compose_installation.sh** script.

* After that, run *Elk_Script.sh* script.

* This will set up the ELK stack for us.

* You can access ELK's web interface (*kibana*) at http://YourIP:5601

* Since we have not defined the Logstash source, we will get the following screen
  ![Kibana Welcome](images/monitoring/Kibana.jpg)

* In order to define Logstash source, we need to run the tomcat containers with the following flag.

```
docker run -d -p 8888:8080 -v /home/ubuntu/tomcat-users.xml:/usr/local/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml --log-driver=syslog --log-opt syslog-address=tcp://LogstashIP:5000 tomcat
```

* If you are exporting logs to Logstash successfully, you will get the following screen
  ![Logstash Configured](images/monitoring/Log_success.png)

* Then click on *Discover* to see the logs.

## Performance Monitoring

### Prometheus

#### Set up the Prometheus Stack

* Some knowledge on Prometheus is needed to understand how this stack works.

* From the same repo, run **Prometheus.sh** script.

* This script will set up Prometheus stack.

* Access the dashboard(*Grafana*) on http://YourIP:3000

* Access credentials are

```
user: admin
password: foobar
```

* Click the Grafana Menu at the top left corner (looks like a fireball).

* Click Data Sources.

* Click the green button Add Data Source.
![Datasource](images/monitoring/Add_Data_Source.png)

* In order to monitor application metrics from tomcat containers, we need to run **cadvisor** container on the nodes which also runs tomcat containers (The host which runs tomcat containers).

* To run cadvisor execute the following command.

```
sudo docker run   --volume=/:/rootfs:ro   --volume=/var/run:/var/run:rw   --volume=/sys:/sys:ro   --volume=/var/lib/docker/:/var/lib/docker:ro   --publish=9090:8080   --detach=true   --name=cadvisor google/cadvisor:latest
```

* To add Tomcat container host as a target, edit prometheus/prometheus/prometheus.yml file.

#### Install Dashboard

* To see the metrics on Grafana, you need to install the custom dashboard.

* Simply download the dashboard and select from the Grafana menu -> Dashboards -> Import.

* [Download Dashboard](https://grafana.net/dashboards/179).

* After configuring everything, the dashboard will look like the following image.

## Cloud Based Monitoring Solutions

### Papertrail

#### Main Configurations

* Go to https://papertrailapp.com/signup?plan=free

* Sign up for the service

  ![signup](images/monitoring/1.png)

* Once sign up choose `Add a system`

  ![system](images/monitoring/2.png)

* This is the URL to which we will ship the logs. Copy the URL for using in rsyslog configuration.

  ![url](images/monitoring/3.png)

*Note: Url will be different for you*

#### Setting up Logspout Container

* To send logs from applications running in a Docker container, we use a small container developed by [gliderlabs](https://hub.docker.com/r/gliderlabs/logspout/)

* To start a logspout container, run: [Reference](http://help.papertrailapp.com/kb/configuration/configuring-centralized-logging-from-docker/)

```
docker run --restart=always -d -p 80:80\
  -v=/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock gliderlabs/logspout  \
  syslog://logs4.papertrailapp.com:10656
```

* Replace `logs4.papertrailapp.com:10656` with one of your Papertrail log destinations.

* Now this contaner run in a background with port mapping 80:80.

#### Monitoring logs

* Once there is an entry for log in other container starts, Logspout Container helps to collect the logs from various Containers to papertrail automatically.

* Visit `Dashboard` in [papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com/dashboard).

  ![Dashboard](images/monitoring/4.png)

* Click `All Systems` from Dashboard to view and edit the setings of various systems *(in our case containers)*.

  ![All Systems](images/monitoring/5.png)

* Change the name of each system with respect to container for easy understanding.

* Click `Events` to monitor logs.

  ![Events](images/monitoring/6.png)

#### Creating an Alert

* To create an alert based on log, `search` for the entry and `Save Search`.

  ![Alert](images/monitoring/7.png)

* `Save Search` will open a dialog in which you can choose a name and click `Save and Setup an Alert`

  ![Save Search](images/monitoring/8.png)

* It will redirect to page in which you can choose various forms of alert like mail, hipchat, slack, campfire, etc...

  ![Mail](images/monitoring/9.png)

* Once the settings are provided and created an alert, settings are saved and we can Update, delete and modify the search.

  ![Mail](images/monitoring/10.png)

#### Verifying an alert

* We get an alert in mail once the query based on our search is occurred.

  ![Mail alert](images/monitoring/11.png)

  ![Mail alert](images/monitoring/12.png)

### Datadog

* Signup for a 14 day trial account in [datadog](https://app.datadoghq.com/signup)

  ![Signup](images/monitoring/13.png)

#### Installation

* Once signup login to the console choose `Integrations` --> `Agent` in it then proceed with installing for Ubuntu to monitor host.

![Integrations container](images/monitoring/15.png)

* Use this command to install a `datadog agent` in host using a script.

```
DD_API_KEY=1ba0c0a88c3dcf52b076886045f47a8c bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataDog/dd-agent/master/packaging/datadog-agent/source/install_agent.sh)"
```

* Once it is done after few minutes the datadog agent will start monitoring host.

* You can stop monitoring by stopping the agent by running the following command.

```
sudo /etc/init.d/datadog-agent stop
```

* To monitor containers again from console choose `Integrations` --> `Agent` in it then proceed with installing docker container to monitor other containers.

  ![Integrations container](images/monitoring/14.png)

* Use this command to install a `datadog docker-dd-agent` in host.

```
docker run -d --name dd-agent -h `hostname` -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /proc/:/host/proc/:ro -v /sys/fs/cgroup/:/host/sys/fs/cgroup:ro -e API_KEY=1ba0c0a88c3dcf52b076886045f47a8c datadog/docker-dd-agent:latest
```

#### Monitoring

* Once it is done after few minutes the datadog agent will start monitoring host and other containers.

* We can monitor this from console by visiting `Infrastructure` and choosing the `Hostname`.

  ![Monitoring](images/monitoring/16.png)

* Datadog monitoring other containers can be viewed by clicking the `inspect` from hostname.

  ![Monitoring_container](images/monitoring/17.png)

* It will open a dialog in which you can choose docker dashboard to view the complete monitoring report of docker.

  ![Container_Apps](images/monitoring/18.png)

* By choosing docker dashboard, will open up new page displaying the complete information about other containers.
